## Overview

### The project

The project is based on the challenge from the [DailyUI](https://www.dailyui.co/) website, where everyday you get a new UI challenge.
The UI final design is first posted on my Twitter. I will then start to code the pages I created using my current abilities and what I am also currently learning.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements.
- Each link is interactive and will send the user to a different link.

## My process

I started creating the `index` html page with the main buttons and texts. I also added images and icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to visually separate each button with each logo.
I created a `README` file and a `style-guide` file and added information such as : color, font family, which would be the best width for the card being created.
I also created my own favicon to use on this and future projects.

It is a mobile page, but I decided to create as a card so it can be viewed from both mobile and desktop/laptop.

Adding a `reset` CSS page to the project so I can freely use CSS to achieve the goal of the design.

After the index page, I started working on the CSS, using my last [FrontEndMentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/order-summary-card-solution-ryKGnnOEc) as a reference to build the css of this one.

Practing flexbox and media query, and also creating a color pallete without checking any website with premade ones.
The anchor buttons were more complicated. Center the text and the icons were more tricy than I expected but I manage to do it using one of the alignment options from flexbox display.

After finishing and testing the first page, I started the second one using the same CSS files and a similiar HTML structure.
